        <ul>
          <li><strong>1. Light:</strong> Place your plants where they get the right amount of sunlight. Too much or too little can harm them.</li>
          <li><strong>2. Water:</strong> Water only when the soil is dry. Overwatering is a common mistake—our Auto Water Pump solves this by sensing soil moisture.</li>
          <li><strong>3. Humidity:</strong> Many houseplants love humidity. Mist them or use a pebble tray for best results.</li>
          <li><strong>4. Clean Leaves:</strong> Dust can block sunlight. Wipe leaves gently with a damp cloth every few weeks.</li>
          <li><strong>5. Fertilize:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer during the growing season for lush, healthy growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Bonus:</strong> With Auto Water Pump, you can automate watering and get notifications if your plant needs attention. No more guessing—just healthy, happy plants!

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Succulents & Cacti:</strong> Water every 2-3 weeks, letting soil dry completely between waterings.</li>
          <li><strong>Ferns & Tropical Plants:</strong> Keep soil consistently moist, but not soggy. Water when the top inch feels dry.</li>
          <li><strong>Seasonal Changes:</strong> Plants need less water in winter and more in summer. Adjust your schedule accordingly.</li>
          <li><strong>Smart Sensors:</strong> Our Auto Water Pump uses sensors to water only when needed, preventing root rot and stress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Always check the soil before watering. With automation, you’ll never have to worry about over- or under-watering again!
